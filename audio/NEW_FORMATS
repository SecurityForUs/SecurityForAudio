New audio formats can be used easily.  There's only a few restrictions:

- __[AUDIO]FMT structure must be defined as audiofmt
- All functions must remain the same name (i.e.: AudioCheck(), ParseAudioFile() & FreeAudioFile() must exist)
- Only one audio type can be enabled at a time

To specify the audio format to use see defs.h
